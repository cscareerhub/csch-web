[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/076322a1-ac5f-457f-8028-9e33d088fba0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/cscareerhub-next/deploys)

We are a community of software engineers on a mission of lifelong learning.

CS Career Hub was created to help guide engineers at any point in their career. Over 18,000 users have joined our community, ranging from first-year students to hiring managers. In the past few years, we've facilitated thousands of mock interviews and resume reviews with candidates. With plenty of plans on the roadmap, you can expect even more to come.

And this is our website! You'll find information about CSCH, the staff that runs, links to the Wiki & FAQ, and ways to contact us.
