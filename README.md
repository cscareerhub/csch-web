# CSCH on Next + Netlify

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/076322a1-ac5f-457f-8028-9e33d088fba0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/cscareerhub-next/deploys)

We are a community of software engineers on a mission of lifelong learning.

CS Career Hub was created to help guide engineers at any point in their career. Over 18,000 users have joined our community, ranging from first-year students to hiring managers. In the past few years, we've facilitated thousands of mock interviews and resume reviews with candidates. With plenty of plans on the roadmap, you can expect even more to come.

And this is our website! You'll find information about CSCH, the staff that runs, links to the Wiki & FAQ, and ways to contact us.

Interested in seeing what's next or contributing? Take a look at our [roadmap](https://github.com/cscareerhub/csch-web/projects/1).

2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`.

3. Run the development server with `yarn dev`.

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. The page auto-updates as you edit any file.

5. In development, create a branch with the following naming scheme.

```
feature/<yourfeature>
bug/<yourbugfix>
docs/<yourdocchange>
test/<yourtestingchange>
misc/<yourmiscchange>
```

6. Once you've made change, create a pull request to the CSCH megabot repo's development branch with the type of change, which should correspond to the first part of your branch name, in the PR title.

```
branch name: docs/change
PR title: [docs] Changed this and that
```

All PRs will require at least one review from CSCH staff. If it's been over a week, feel free to ping us once in the Discord.
