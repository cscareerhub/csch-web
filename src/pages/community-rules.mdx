# Discord's ToS and Community Guidelines

Discord requires that you follow their terms of service and community guidelines. Breaking these may require us to report and ban you.

➜ Discord's Terms of Service: https://discord.com/terms

➜ Discord's Community Guidelines: https://discord.com/guidelines

# Community Rules

1. Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism, or hate speech will be tolerated.

2. No spam or self-promotion (server invites, advertisements, etc) without permission from a staff member. This includes DMing fellow members. Please use the appropriate channels to spam certain content, read the channel descriptions on how to post in there: [#share-your-content](https://discord.com/channels/334891772696330241/343186849348583463) Post your content here that you want to share

3. No NSFW, age-restricted or obscene content. This includes text, images, or links featuring nudity, sex, hard violence, or other graphically disturbing content.

4. Any toxicity is subject to a temporary or permanent ban. More specifically, toxicity includes, but is not limited to, a condescending or otherwise offensively impolite or ill-mannered attitude and tone, intolerance, lack of decorum, and ignoring warnings. Other offenses are subject to moderator and administrator judgement.

5. Avoid discussions on dating, politics, religion, or other controversial topics. An exception is when discussing specific topics related to software engineering. There are other Discord servers for that.

6. Please refrain from discussing matters relating to suicide and similar issues. None of us are professionals nor can help meaningfully. Suicide hotlines: http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html.

    [#mental-health](https://discord.com/channels/334891772696330241/342789684876935168): For non critical discussions pertaining to mental health.

# Channel Etiquette

1. Each channel is meant for a specific topic. Take conversation to the appropriate channel.

2. Consider the audience. Your words are read by more than those you address them to, and conversation here is expected to remain professional and inclusive.

3. The [#tech-chat](https://discord.com/channels/334891772696330241/334891772696330241) channel is for general conversation around CS careers, programming, and the tech industry. If you find the conversation steering away from that please take it to [#offtopic](https://discord.com/channels/334891772696330241/339946151442776064).

4. Keep discussions about Leetcode et al. to the [#programming-challenges](https://discord.com/channels/334891772696330241/339946171537686540) channel.

5. No advertising outside of the channels in the Advertising channel category. Additionally, [#share-your-content](https://discord.com/channels/334891772696330241/343186849348583463) is only for sharing content you created yourself and is not for services.

6. Do not spam the same messages in multiple channels. Choose the most relevant channel and send your message once.

# Mock Interview Guidelines

1. Be courteous. If you're a no-show or are unreasonably late to the scheduled interview, you will be blacklisted from the channel for a week. Repeated offences may result in permanent expulsion from mock interviews.

2. Spectating an interview is allowed only if both the interviewer and interviewee have no qualms with it. Please refrain from repeatedly connecting/disconnecting from the voice channel as it disturbs the ongoing interview.

3. While we understand that certain circumstances are unavoidable, try to ensure that both parties' internet connection and microphone are in working condition.

If you want to ask something and you're unsure whether or not it breaks the rules then [ask-a-mod](https://discord.com/channels/334891772696330241/1040321855581593681).
