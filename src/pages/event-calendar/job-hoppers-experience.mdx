# Veteran Job Hoppers: Experiences at Opposite Ends of the Spectrum

## Friday, June 25 2021 @ 5PM PT / 8PM ET

[Recording & Question Timestamps](/event-recordings/job-hoppers-experience)

Join the CSCH crew for an evening chat about the experiences of two veteran job hoppers - one hopping through all the Big Ns and through many startups! Have your questions ready for Kevin and vcarl as we explore big corp life vs startup life, job hopping, and more!

You can already submit your questions for Friday in [#event-questions](https://discord.com/channels/334891772696330241/849380416036143195), where you can vote with a "thumbs up" on your favorite ones. Questions with the highest votes will make it into our rotation, so be sure to get yours in early!

Our two speakers are serial job hoppers - that is to say they have experienced a lot of different companies. However they hop on different ends of teh spectrum. One has had lots of Big N experiences and the other has been through the gauntlet at various startups. Just some of things you could ask questions about are:

- Differences between the Big N and startup experience
- Experiences at each company or type of company
- Experiences changing jobs frequently
- Climbing the career or monetary ladders
