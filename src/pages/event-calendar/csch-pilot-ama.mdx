# CS Career Hub Pilot AMA: Learn More About the CSCH Community and Team and Ask CS Career Questions

## Friday, May 28th 2021 @ 5 PM PST / 8 PM EST

Join the CSCH crew for an evening chat about anything SWE! Have your questions ready for our guests Kevin, Brenda, Gopher, cassy, and semi as we explore their history in the field, the CSCH community, and their perspective on the CS career questions asked.

We will begin taking your questions the day before in [#ama-questions](https://discord.com/channels/334891772696330241/849380416036143195), where you can vote with a "thumbs up" on your favorite ones. Questions with the highest votes will make it into our rotation, so be sure to get yours in early!

As usual, this is a professional event and we expect the best out of participants - both guests and audience members. We'll see you on Friday! [#DiscordStages](https://discord.gg/cscareerhub) [#ad](https://discord.gg/cscareerhub)
