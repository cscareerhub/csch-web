# Server rules

1. Don’t ask to ask a question. Just ask your question, and knowledgeable people will answer if they are available.

2. Before asking company specific questions (e.g OA2 assessment for Amazon) please use the search function because more often than not, they have already been answered.

3. Avoid discussions on politics, religion, or other controversial topics. There are other Discord servers for that.

4. Don’t belittle other members if their career goals are different than yours. There are many paths to success in CS careers; it isn’t an optimization problem. No elitism.

5. Please refrain from discussing matters relating to suicide and similar issues. None of us are professionals nor can help meaningfully. Suicide hotlines: http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html.

6. Any toxicity is subject to a temporary or permanent ban. More specifically, toxicity includes, but is not limited to, a condescending or otherwise offensively impolite or ill-mannered attitude and tone, intolerance, lack of decorum, and ignoring warnings. Other offenses are subject to moderator and administrator judgement.

7. While information security (hacking) is a respectable discipline within technology, it needs to be done within the confines of the law. If you post a hacking request or any other entities' personal information or source code, you will immediately be banned.
