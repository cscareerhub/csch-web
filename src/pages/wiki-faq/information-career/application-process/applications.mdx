The first step of job hunting: the application.

---

Applications are the first step of any job hunting season. Many developers will send out dozens if not hundreds of applications for jobs until they get a few replies. But it doesn't have to be that way if you create a [solid resume](/wiki-faq/information-career/application-process/resumes) and do some simple [networking](/wiki-faq/information-career/application-process/referrals). There are also [quite a few sites](/wiki-faq/information-career/application-process/job-hunting-websites) that will bring companies to you instead of the other way around.â€Œ

Dive deeper into the steps of job hunting efficiently and creating a quality application so you don't have to send out hundreds before getting a hit.
