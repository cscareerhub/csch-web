Landed an interview? Congrats! Now for the hardest part â€” here are some steps to prepare.

---

Think of job hunting as a date. Before you go on a date, you make some preparations. You take a nice shower, put on your best look and smell. You keep in mind a few things to talk about (and what to avoid). Job hunting is no different.

Depending on the stage of your career, your approach will be different. If you're reading this, you're likely new to the industry. This page will be mostly for the entry and junior level workers. The first thing you should do is to lay everything on the table and figure out what you have to work with and what you want to do.

To have the best success, make sure you have the following:

1. You are in the mindset to look for a job. There is no distractor.
2. You have a quiet room to talk to your interviewer in.
3. You have questions prepared for your interviewer.
4. You've solidified your foundation in computer science.
5. You're working on your project or you're making a regular contribution to other people's projects.

Once you have these down, you are ready to pick up the call and talk to your interviewer.
